# Home automation

Collection repository for home automation playbooks, and other configurations

### Ansible
Used to configure the raspberry pi. Because of the nature of `rpi-update`, this might be needed as 
an extra step before running playbooks. This was especially a problem if `$(uname -r) < /lib/modules`.
